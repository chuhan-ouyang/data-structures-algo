# Data Structures and Algorithms
Summarization of key problems in data structures and algorithms

## General Coding Patterns
* while(n--) {op} is an elegant way to perform op n times
  * same as for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
* class design:
  * private fields: _fieldNames
* if one line while/if, don't need brackets
* figuring out loops is about finding repetitive pattern, deciding bounds 
* basic data types: type a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, d = 4
* two comparisons: forcing one of the two to be the longer one
  * if want A to be larger
  * if (b > a) swap(a, b)
